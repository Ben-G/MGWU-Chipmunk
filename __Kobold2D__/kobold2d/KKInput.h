/** Kobold2D User Input handler that gives you both a polling API (eg isKeyDown) and an event-driven API configurable via config.lua.
 KKInput supports all input methods: keyboard, mouse, touch, motion (accelerometer and gyroscope) and gestures.
 
 The design of the KKInput API is meant to be as simple as possible, giving you many convenience functions. For example, mouse button
 double-clicks are treated as if they were separate buttons so you don't have to write your own code to test for double-clicks. You
 can also easily test mouse button states in combination with keyboard modifierFlags to detect Control-Clicks and the like.
 
 It is legal (no compile error) to call keyboard & mouse methods on iOS, as is calling touch, motion and gesture methods on Mac OS. 
 Of course you won't get meaningful results/values, the real benefit is that you can write #ifdef-less code.
 
 Note: all "ThisFrame" methods are only useful if you poll the state every frame (eg scheduled update method without an interval),
 otherwise you might "miss" the event because the state will only remain true for one frame.
